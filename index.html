				<p align=left> The Makino Dragonflies (or Dragonflies) are a powerful organization that, in its early days, focused on uplifting the Asian-American,
					specifically Japanese-American, community in California. While it still aims to achieve this, anyone can join, today. The organization focuses on small communities, supplying food, water, and protection. They even offer weapon training for
					some.
					Being recruited, however, has been shown to be incredibly difficult, as the group is noted to be quite selective in the process. The most notable aspect is that all members must show unbending loyalty and be outfitted with a killswitch
					implant.
					The organization continues to see growth and sometimes clashes with local gangs in the area. However, many of these have been eradicated because of the Dragonflies.</p>
				<p align=left>
				<h2> History </h2>
				</p>
				<HR>
				<p align=left>
				<h3> Early History & Formation </h3>
				</p>
				<p align=left> The Makino Dragonflies was formed by Makino Narumi in 2037 with help from her family and friends. The principal that guided the organization was that the poor Japanese-Americans in California should have a job, shelter, food,
					and water. The dragonfly is the symbol of her family.
					The operation was primarily funded by Narumi herself, with help from investors from her family. It was not long before Narumi began opening operations to Asian-Americans as a whole. Narumi also expanded the organization to teach teenagers
					and provide them with internship opportunities and interview advice. She would provide dinners for families on holidays, deliver water, and bought properties for private tutoring.
				<p align=left> By 2040, the organization had reached multiple parts of California, but its main base of operations was in San Francisco. The organization began increasingly more funded on donations. However, when initial riots broke out
					during the early Twilight Spring, the organization began to teach individuals how to fight.
					Many of the early recruits were related to the Makino family, but eventually the organization started to recruit individuals who applied. Recruitment, however, was highly selective. In 2039, the Makino Dragonflies started operations in
					Nevada. In 2042, the organization announced it would extend its benefits to all Americans residing in California. </p>
				<p align=left>
				<h3> Changes During Twilight Spring </h3>
				</p>
				<p> During the Twilight Spring, the Makino Dragonflies made several changes to ensure survival for the crisis. They created squads and hired mercenaries to protect neighborgoods from gangs, crime, and general destruction from riots. They
					acted as a vigilante force during the Twilight Spring, seized illegal goods, and trained local militias.
					It was also during the Spring that the organization sought to protect and provide for everyone in California. Even though the organization is not large in terms of members, it has an abundance of wealth and an intricate network of
					connections. Some, however, speculate that the group is not entirely honest about their operations.
					Accusations arose that the Makino Dragonflies were working with crime families or were paying tribute to them. Others opined that the group was selling or using the weapons it seized. </p>

				<p align=left> Makino Narumi is a leader of a famous California organization named the Makino Dragonflies. She is the current leader of the Makino Dragonflies, proclaiming herself to be the queen of the group.
					She married Makino Narumi in 2033. She is the third child of four in her family. Her father was a wealthy businessman, and her mother was an actress. </p>
				<h2> Early Life </h2>
				<p align=left> Makino Narumi (born Hirose Narumi) was born in San Francisco, United States, on 29 January 2014, into a wealthy family. Narumi's father, Hirose Kyuwa, operated several casinos in California. </p>
				<p align=left> Narumi's mother, Hirose Aoki, was a prominent actress and winner of several awards. Narumi attended the University of California, Berkeley, and received a bachelor's degree in economics. During this time, she also managed one
					of her father's casinos.
					At Berkeley, she also met her husband, Makino Tsurayaki.</p>
				<p align=left> During her drives around California, Narumi was alarmed by some of the citizens' appalling living conditions. Narumi swiftly sought to raise awareness and began efforts to provide some relief to the poorer areas.
					Narumi would frequently donate to charities, families, and libraries. She chastised the wealthy who did not follow her gospel of wealth. The subjects of her castigation were those who proclaimed to fight for the poor but did nothing
					about it.
					She made specific statements about those who had large mansions and did not hire American citizens for work. Some celebrities, such as Ace Frederick, pushed back, claiming that Narumi came from the lap of luxury and was no better. Defenders
					of Narumi pointed out
					that she lived a more minimalist lifestyle than her parents, however. </p>
				<p align=left> Narumi was also vocally opposed to the political situation and civil concerns that caused American society's woe. She blamed both political parties for contributing to the nauseating living situations of many Americans.
					Narumi also rebuked politicians that empowered big businesses and curtailed welfare. She berated big businesses who claimed to be civil rights activists; but she pointed out that they were superficial and rarely, if at all, donated to civil
					rights organizations.
					Some claim that Narumi's attack on big business contributed to the cause of the Twilight Spring. </p>
				<h2> Makino Dragonflies </h2>
				<p align=left> Narumi was young when she began to start financing and building the Makino Dragonflies. She founded it on 16 February, 2037. Operations first began on a relatively small scale, focusing on areas that received less attention than others.
					 Initially, Narumi focused on Japanese-Americans. She offered many of them jobs in her casino, provided them with seasonal dinners, prepared them for job interviews, had a limited teaching service, and would deliver water to homes.
					 Early efforts were selective in who would receive these benefits, but as more funding was put into the organization, she began to branch out to more families and communities. A little later, she would provide the same benefits to all Asian Americans. And finally, to any American. </p>
				<p align=left> Narumi received widespread support for her actions and quickly rose in popularity with the general public. However, she declined numerous meeting requests from talkshow hosts and filmmakers. Many celebrities publicly announced that they were donating to the organization, something Narumi had mixed feelings about.
					 While Narumi appreciated the support, she felt that it was insincere for celebrities to broadcast it all over social media.</p>
				<p align=left> Despite her actions, Narumi was subject to criticism from the fact that she was limiting her scope to Japanese-Americans and Asian-Americans. Narumi never publicly defended herself from these statements. Further criticism was levied at how selective the organization was with its aid as well as recruitment.
					Narumi responded by saying that she sought to hire only the best so that she could provide the best. She also claimed that, early on, with limited funding, it was unreasonable to assume that she could save everybody. Of course, as the organization grew larger, the criticisms on the group's limitations became less frequent. </p>

					<p>I'm Moonlatte. Welcome to my website. I'm a bit of a writer, bit of a coder, and largely interested in worldbuilding and history.</p>
					<p>I have been doing creative writing for several years now, and I have no reason to stop. It really is a passion of mine, and I am glad to be a part of a great writing community. I enjoy seeing what others create, too.</p>
					<p>I love history, ideas, people, and seeing how they all connect together in the world. Maybe we can make something together...I love being with others and joining communities or hanging with others.</p>
					<p>Since you're still reading, you must want to know more, so I'll keep going.</p>
					<p>Cyberpunk has always been a favorite genre of mine. It is destructive, horrifying, but closer to reality than some believe. It can build up a lot of interesting gadgets and escapisms while hiding the true terror that lurks underneath.
					</p>
					<p>When I'm not doing my usual worldbuilding routine, I'm probably picking up another work of fiction, sometimes non-fiction. If not that, likely cooking and doing exercise.</p>
					<p>I am currently going to school and working, so my schedule is pretty much always full. But music usually helps, so I put on something metal or electronic.</p>
					<p>That is all for now, thanks for checking this out. Happy reading, viewer.</p>
